In this lab you will learn how to start modernizing your desktop apps for Windows 10. You will start by working with a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) app, but the same principles apply to a Windows Forms (WinForms) app.

### Distribution and versioning

You are now able to package your desktop apps in the same way as Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. This enables a more secure, trusted, and flexible way of distributing your app.

### UI modernization

This step will demonstrate how to add a modern WebView to your app based upon the EdgeHTML rendering engine. This WebView supports the latest web standards such as HTML5, and CSS3.

### Adaptive Cards

Adaptive Cards are a new way for developers to exchange card content in a common and consistent way. You will discover how new cards can be designed, followed by how to consume them from WPF - and finally how you make these cards actionable through input fields.

### Windows 10 APIs

Modern Windows 10 APIs are available not only to Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, but to WPF and WinForms apps too. In this section you will use local toast notifications as an example of a Windows 10 API you can introduce into your desktop app - these same principles apply to many features such as Contact / People integration, Live Tiles, and more.
